# Movie-Theater-ERD-Database-Setup-SQL

For this project, I created an ERD for a movie theater (customers, tickets, movies, and theaters) using LucidChart
I'm using this guidelines to make my ERD Chart:
- A customer can purchase tickets to see movies, though a customer does not have to have had purchased a ticket to be a customer
- Each ticket is only good for one customer to see one movie
- Each movie can be shown in each theater, and every theater can show any movie

The ERD shows the relationships with both cardinality (maximum relationships) and ordinality (minimum). The entities also shows Primary and Foreign Keys, some additional fields and data types.

Once the ERD was completed, I created the tables in the database using the relationships, constraints, and columns that I defined in my ERD.
